### Who am I?

Hello, and welcome to my rendition of yet another vaguely academic personal site!

More seriously, my name is Leonard Tang, and I'm a sophomore at Harvard studying Mathematics and Computer Science. Outside of the classroom, I *attempt* to do research in deep learning. During Summer 2020, I had the privilege of working with Gabriel Kreiman and Mengmi Zhang on context-aware computer vision and corresponding adversarial attacks. On campus (or some virtual surrogate of one in this covid era), I find myself involved in (almost exclusively) [four-letter student organizations](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/).  

### Why this Site?

This website is meant to serve as a collection of my notes, learnings, projects, and ruminations -- both technical and non-technical -- that I accumulate throughout my education. It is difficult to overstate how useful academic blogs have been in my growth and understanding, and I'd like to think that this site might pay that debt forward. I hope you're able to dig around and find something that piques your interest!
