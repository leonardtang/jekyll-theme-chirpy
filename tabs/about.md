### **Who am I?**

Hello, and welcome to my rendition of yet another vaguely academic personal site!

More seriously, my name is Leonard Tang, and I'm a sophomore at Harvard pursuing a joint concentration in Mathematics and Computer Science. Outside of class, I attempt to do research in computer vision/deep learning. During Summer 2020, I had the privilege of working with Gabriel Kreiman and Mengmi Zhang on context-aware computer vision and adversarial attacks. On campus (or some virtual surrogate of one in this covid era), I find myself involved in primarily [four-letter student organizations](https://www.harvardconsulting.org/).  

### **Why this Site?**

This website is meant to serve as a collection of notes, intellectual tidbits, projects, and ruminations -- both technical and non-technical. It is difficult to overstate how useful academic blogs have been in aiding my understanding of complex concepts, and I'd like to think that this site might pay that debt forward. I hope you're able to dig around -- start looking into the Categories section -- and find something that piques your interest!

### **My Experience**
