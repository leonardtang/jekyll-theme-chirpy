### **Who am I?**

Hello, and welcome to my rendition of yet another vaguely academic personal site!

More seriously, my name is Leonard Tang, and I'm a sophomore(-ish) at Harvard pursuing a joint concentration in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'm currently taking two gap semesters for the Spring and Fall of 2021.

Outside of class, I *attempt* to do research in computer vision/deep learning. More recently, I've been fortunate enough to make a foray into NLP through an incredible internship experience at [Gamalon](https://gamalon.com/).

I'm also passionate about guitar (mostly acoustic!), violin, the blues, drone cinematography, and [Datamatch](https://datamatch.me/). 

### **Why this Site?**

This website is meant to serve as a collection of notes, intellectual tidbits, projects, and ruminations -- both technical and non-technical. It is difficult to overstate how useful academic blogs have been in aiding my understanding of complex concepts, and I'd like to think that this site might pay that debt forward. I hope you're able to dig around -- start looking into the Categories section -- and find something that piques your interest!

### **My Experience**
