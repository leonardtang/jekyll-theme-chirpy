### At a Glance

Here, I attempt to explain Yoon Kim's 2014 paper on sentence classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. If you want to skip the nitty-gritty details and jump straight to the code, feel free to check out my PyTorch implementation of the model [here](https://github.com/leonardtang/CNN-for-NLP).


### But What is a CNN?

Convolutional Neural Networks are an extension of vanilla neural networks. The key idea of is the *kernel* object (or synonymously, a filter or feature detector). The kernel is what produces a *convolution* from a given input/representation.

A CNN is comprised of *convolutional layers* and *linear layers* (what you'd see in a vanilla neural network). The role of the convolutional layers is to extract key *features* from the input data, while the linear layers take in those features as inputs and *classify* (i.e. predict) a certain output label.
